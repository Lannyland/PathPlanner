00:00|You are in sliding autonomy planning mode. The countdown timer at top left (green) shows how many seconds are left for you to complete the current exercise. The score at bottom left shows how good the UAV path is. And your main objective is to score as high as possible within the given exercise time.|0,1065,425,75
00:15|Like before, you can use the W, A, S, D keys to rotate the view and use mouse scrollwheel to zoom in or out. Clicking the Pan button switchs to panning with the W, A, S, D keys and click the Rotate button switchs back to rotate mode. Go ahead and try it.|1710,506,200,60
00:30|The slider on the left shows how much UAV flying time is left for you to plan (60 at the top) and how much time you want to allocate to the current path segment (10 in the middle).|1710,813,100,225
00:45|Click the Plan Path button to get started and see the path suggested for you by Artificial Intelligence.|1710,853,200,40
01:00| Click on the left slider to change its value and see different paths suggested by AI. There might be a little bit lag when AI autonomy is computing the path for the current path segment.|1710,813,100,225
01:30|Click the Approve button when you are happy with the current suggested path segment.|1710,593,200,45
01:45|Optionally you can set the End Point for the next path segment by clicking the Set End Point button. Then you can drag the sphere marker to place it to your desired location. Then click Plan Path button to plan. Try that a few times.|1710,902,200,50
02:15|The slider on the right sets the resolution of the slider on the left. Change the value of the right slider to 9 and then drag the left slider handle to see how it works. Note that the sliders will only let you select valid values that makes it possible for the UAV to reach the end point you set.|1810,813,100,225
02:35|Click Plan Path to create a new path segment and drag the left slider to see paths suggested by AI. Approve the path segment you like the best by clicking Approve button.|1710,854,200,275
02:50|Clicking the Start Over button will restart the path planning task from the very beginning.  Go ahead and try it.|1710,552,200,40
03:00|Your main task is to score as high as possible with path planning, a secondary task is to answer questions when your code name Eagle is called in the chat window. Make your answer brief (1-2 words). Hit the Enter key to chat and hit Enter when you are done. Go ahead and try it.|0,450,450,395
03:30|Try different things so you are comfortable with the controls. Fly the UAV around and try to score as high as you can while replying questions in the chat window when your code name Eagle is called.|-100,-100,0,0
04:00|Once you finish with the path planning, you can click the Fly Path button to see a simulated flight. As long as you don't start over, you completion time will be recorded at the time when you click the Fly Path button. Go ahead and try it.|1710,447,200,62
04:30|In the real exercise, if you are happy with the path created, you can click the Next button to complete the exercise early. Otherwise, when time runs out, you will be prompted to stop. In this training session you can click Next when your training session is over.|1710,88,200,75
