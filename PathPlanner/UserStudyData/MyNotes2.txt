Manual:

Strengths:
Easy to learn, 
Go where I want,

Weaknesses:
Easy to miss
Doesn't cover the areas throughly
Requires user's concentration
Room for user error.
Not accurate (with time pressure)
Time costly to start over.

Improvement:
Stop timer when UAV stops.
A way to remove the user error from bad kyestrokes.
Joystick



Pattern:

Strengths:
Easy to use.
Little pressure.
Could retries different ideas

Weaknesses:
Runs out of time quickly with large patterns.
Not as flexible as manual.
Can't control how much time to spend on each pattern.

Improvements:
More patterns (including user defined)
The ability to modify.




Sliding Autonomy:

Strengths:
AI does it for you.
Plan paths I had not considered.
Easier to respond to chat.
Scores better.

Weaknesses:
Doesn't' exactly do what we tell it to do.
The effort I would have to put in to get the exact path that I was looking for. I would have to slide the sliders exactly to get the track that I wanted.
Twist the method to get the exact path I want.
Covers the area user doesn't want to. (User is wrong.)
It doesn't always take the path you had imagined would be the most efficient path to be. (because human is good at detecting bad moves -- verification, and because human is not always right in other sense)
Less control, because human wants to tell AI what to do.
When human can't understand why a path is choosen, human is confused.
Doesn't go where I want it to go.


Improvements:
Task-difficulty map side by side (or combined somehow)
Second slider was so confusing
Middle enrouting points.
-- functions I didn't program:
-- move endpoints (another sliding thing?)
-- undo
-- Compare paths function.
